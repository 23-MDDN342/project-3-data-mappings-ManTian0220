Throughout the project, I learned the importance of iterative development and adapting my approach based on a deeper understanding of the project requirements. As I progressed and wrote code, I decided to create an entirely new face instead of the sun face, which is my sketched face. In the end of the project I got a cup head just as I designed, and I am happy about it. Although the face shaping and characterization seemed successful during the training quiz, the final application to the real world failed due to difficulties in triggering highly variable features. Despite efforts to resolve the issue, it remained unsolved. If given more time, rectifying this problem would be my top priority.
